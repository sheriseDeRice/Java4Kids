## Introduction

### Today’s Trend

The world is moving into a digitalised century throughout the years. Everything is connected to and can be accessed through the Internet. Being “digitised” brings convenience to society and improves the way people work in real-time. Our lives are now more efficient. For example:

➢ Google Drive allows users to upload documents and be able to access them anywhere;
➢ The mobile bank application allows us to check the bank statements and make money transactions easily with a simple and clear Graphic User Interface; 
➢ Online shopping services such as Amazon allow people to order items they want from the websites and have it delivered to the door.

With the needs of technology growing rapidly, we are relying on the young generation to become the next creator or developer in the future. Therefore, as a Computer Scientist, I wish to create something that can help to educate young children about the basic programming skills and to help the talented child to build up their interest in technology.

### Motivation

This project was inspired by my little cousin who always showed his interests in what I am doing in my studies and for my projects. A 7 years old child walks around me, reading my code, trying to understand and asks lots of questions when I was working at home during weekends. Therefore, I started to think maybe I can create an application to deliver what I have been learning in my first and second year - Java.

### Goal

This software aims to let children from age of 7 to learn to code while having fun. Although, it might not be able to deliver full content about Java programming, the main concept of it will be delivered through multiple puzzle games with different levels for practice. Each game will help children to gain knowledge in a simple way, such as by grouping items or linking relevant pieces together. Users can create an account to save their current progress and be able to compare their current levels and scores with their friends.
