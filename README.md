# Java4Kids

## Abstract
Java4Kids is an educational Android mobile application designed for children from the age of 7 to learn Java programming concept in a less stress and fun way. Although, it might not be able to deliver full content about Java programming, the main concept of it will be delivered through different simple quiz games in the application. Each game will help children to gain knowledge in a simple way such as dragging and dropping relevant pieces together. The user could either login to the application with an account or as a guest. Users are allowed to check their learning progress and add friends to compare their current levels and scores in the application. From the user testings that were done during the development stage, the overall feedback from users was positive, stating that they enjoyed using Java4Kids and found it meaningful.
